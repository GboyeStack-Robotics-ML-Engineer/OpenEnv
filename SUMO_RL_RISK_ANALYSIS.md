## ⚠️ Remaining Risks (Deep Analysis)

### 🔴 HIGH RISK

#### 1. **TraCI Connection Management in HTTP Server**

**Issue**: `SumoEnvironment` uses class variable `CONNECTION_LABEL` that increments globally.

```python
CONNECTION_LABEL = 0  # For traci multi-client support

def __init__(self):
    self.label = str(SumoEnvironment.CONNECTION_LABEL)
    SumoEnvironment.CONNECTION_LABEL += 1
```

**Risk**: In HTTP server with concurrent requests:
- Request 1 creates env (label=0)
- Request 2 creates env (label=1)
- Request 1 resets → closes connection label=0
- Request 2 steps → tries to use label=1
- **Potential conflict if requests overlap**

**Likelihood**: Medium (depends on usage pattern)

**Impact**: High (could cause simulation errors)

**Mitigation**:
```python
# Option 1: Single environment instance (RECOMMENDED)
# Create ONE environment at server startup, reuse for all requests
env = SumoEnvironment(...)  # Created once
app = create_fastapi_app(env, ...)  # Reuses same env

# Option 2: Thread-safe connection management
# Use threading locks around TraCI operations
```

**Decision**: Use single environment instance per container (same as Atari pattern). Each HTTP request uses the same environment. **SOLVES ISSUE**.

---

#### 2. **LIBSUMO vs TraCI Performance Trade-off**

**Background**:
```python
LIBSUMO = "LIBSUMO_AS_TRACI" in os.environ
```

- **TraCI**: Standard, supports GUI, slower (1x speed)
- **LIBSUMO**: No GUI, no parallel sims, faster (8x speed)

**Risk**: Default TraCI could be too slow for RL training.

**Likelihood**: High (traffic sims are inherently slow)

**Impact**: Medium (training takes longer, not broken)

**Mitigation**:
```dockerfile
# Option 1: Use TraCI (default, safer)
# No env var needed, works out of box

# Option 2: Enable LIBSUMO for speed
ENV LIBSUMO_AS_TRACI=1

# Recommendation: Start with TraCI, add LIBSUMO as optimization later
```

**Decision**: Start with TraCI (default), document LIBSUMO option for advanced users.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM RISK

#### 3. **Episode Reset Performance**

**Issue**: Each `reset()` closes and restarts SUMO simulation.

```python
def reset(self, seed=None, **kwargs):
    if self.episode != 0:
        self.close()  # Closes previous simulation
    self._start_simulation()  # Starts new one
```

**Risk**: Reset could take 1-5 seconds (slow for RL training loop).

**Likelihood**: High (this is how SUMO works)

**Impact**: Medium (slows training, doesn't break it)

**Mitigation**:
- Document expected reset time
- Use long episodes (`num_seconds=20000`)
- Consider warm-start optimizations later

**Decision**: Accept this limitation, document it. Not a blocker.

---

#### 4. **CSV Output Accumulation**

**Issue**: Environment can write CSV metrics to disk.

```python
def save_csv(self, out_csv_name, episode):
    df.to_csv(out_csv_name + f"_conn{self.label}_ep{episode}" + ".csv")
```

**Risk**: In Docker, CSV files accumulate → disk space.

**Likelihood**: Low (only if user enables CSV output)

**Impact**: Low (disk space, not functionality)

**Mitigation**:
```python
# In our wrapper, set out_csv_name=None (disables CSV)
env = SumoEnvironment(
    ...,
    out_csv_name=None,  # Disable CSV output
)
```

**Decision**: Disable CSV output by default. Users can enable via volume mount if needed.

---

#### 5. **Network File Path Resolution**

**Issue**: SUMO needs absolute paths to `.net.xml` and `.rou.xml` files.

**Risk**: If paths are wrong in Docker, simulation fails.

**Likelihood**: Low (we control the paths)

**Impact**: High (breaks everything if wrong)

**Mitigation**:
```dockerfile
# Bundle networks at known paths
COPY sumo-rl/sumo_rl/nets/single-intersection/ /app/nets/

# Set absolute paths as defaults
ENV SUMO_NET_FILE=/app/nets/single-intersection.net.xml
ENV SUMO_ROUTE_FILE=/app/nets/single-intersection.rou.xml
```

**Decision**: Bundle example networks, use absolute paths. Test during build.

---

#### 6. **Dynamic Observation/Action Spaces**

**Issue**: Different networks → different action/observation sizes.

```python
# Action space size = number of traffic signal phases (varies)
self.action_space = gym.spaces.Discrete(num_green_phases)

# Observation size = depends on number of lanes (varies)
obs_size = num_green_phases + 1 + 2*num_lanes
```

**Risk**: OpenEnv expects fixed-size spaces?

**Likelihood**: Low (we use single network by default)

**Impact**: Medium (breaks if user changes network)

**Mitigation**:
- Use single-intersection as default (fixed sizes)
- Document that changing networks may change spaces
- Future: Make spaces configurable

**Decision**: Not a blocker. Start with single network, document clearly.

---

### 🟢 LOW RISK

#### 7. **SUMO Version Compatibility**

**Issue**: `ppa:sumo/stable` might update SUMO version over time.

**Risk**: New SUMO version breaks sumo-rl compatibility.

**Likelihood**: Low (SUMO is stable)

**Impact**: Medium (breaks after rebuild)

**Mitigation**:
```dockerfile
# Option 1: Pin SUMO version (if available)
RUN apt-get install -y sumo=1.14.0

# Option 2: Pin sumolib/traci versions
RUN pip install sumolib==1.14.0 traci==1.14.0

# Option 3: Accept latest (simpler, usually works)
```

**Decision**: Start with latest, pin if issues arise.

---

#### 8. **sumolib/traci vs System SUMO Mismatch**

**Issue**: Pip packages `sumolib` and `traci` should match system SUMO version.

**Risk**: Version mismatch causes compatibility issues.

**Likelihood**: Low (sumo-rl handles this)

**Impact**: Medium (simulation errors)

**Mitigation**:
```dockerfile
# Install SUMO first
RUN apt-get install -y sumo sumo-tools

# Then install matching Python packages
RUN pip install sumolib>=1.14.0 traci>=1.14.0
```

**Decision**: Use `>=` versions, should work. Test during build.

---

#### 9. **PettingZoo Version Compatibility**

**Issue**: Code has fallback for PettingZoo 1.24 vs 1.25+

```python
try:
    from pettingzoo.utils import AgentSelector  # 1.25+
except ImportError:
    from pettingzoo.utils import agent_selector as AgentSelector  # 1.24
```

**Risk**: Version incompatibility breaks import.

**Likelihood**: Low (pyproject.toml specifies `pettingzoo>=1.24.3`)

**Impact**: Low (import error, easy to debug)

**Mitigation**:
```dockerfile
RUN pip install pettingzoo>=1.24.3
```

**Decision**: Use version spec from pyproject.toml.

---

#### 10. **Memory Usage with Many Vehicles**

**Issue**: Large traffic networks with thousands of vehicles → high memory.

**Risk**: Container OOM (out of memory).

**Likelihood**: Low (single-intersection is small)

**Impact**: High (container crash)

**Mitigation**:
- Use small default network (single-intersection)
- Document memory requirements for large networks
- Docker memory limits (optional)

**Decision**: Not a blocker. Document memory requirements.

---

#### 11. **Simulation Determinism**

**Issue**: Default `sumo_seed="random"` → non-deterministic.

**Risk**: Can't reproduce training runs.

**Likelihood**: High (default is random)

**Impact**: Low (science issue, not functionality)

**Mitigation**:
```python
# Allow seed control via environment variable
sumo_seed = int(os.getenv("SUMO_SEED", "42"))  # Default fixed seed

# Or keep random, document it
sumo_seed = os.getenv("SUMO_SEED", "random")
```

**Decision**: Default to fixed seed (42) for reproducibility. Document how to use random.

---

#### 12. **Headless Operation (No GUI)**

**Issue**: We force `use_gui=False` in Docker.

**Risk**: Users might want to see simulation GUI.

**Likelihood**: Low (Docker is headless)

**Impact**: Low (convenience feature)

**Mitigation**:
- Document that GUI is not available in Docker
- Suggest local development for GUI
- Future: VNC access to container GUI

**Decision**: Not a blocker. GUI doesn't work in Docker anyway.

---

#### 13. **Docker Image Size**

**Issue**: SUMO + dependencies → large image.

**Estimate**:
- Base: ~200MB
- SUMO: ~500MB
- Python packages: ~200MB
- **Total: ~900MB-1GB**

**Risk**: Large downloads, storage.

**Likelihood**: High (definitely will be large)

**Impact**: Low (acceptable for complex sim)

**Mitigation**:
- Multi-stage builds (future optimization)
- Clear documentation of size
- Accept it (complexity requires space)

**Decision**: Accept ~1GB image size. Not a blocker.

---

#### 14. **Long Simulation Times**

**Issue**: Traffic simulations take time (minutes per episode).

**Example**: 20,000 simulated seconds with delta_time=5 → 4,000 steps per episode.

**Risk**: RL training is slow.

**Likelihood**: High (inherent to traffic simulation)

**Impact**: Medium (slower research, not broken)

**Mitigation**:
- Document expected times
- Recommend shorter episodes for quick tests
- Suggest LIBSUMO for speedup

**Decision**: Document clearly. Not a technical blocker.
